        <h2>Lion</h2>
                <p>Scientific  Name: Panthera leo<br>
                  Size: Head and body, 4.5 to 6.5 feet; tail, 26.25 to 39.5 inches<br>
                  Weight: 265 to 420 pounds<br>
                  Speed: 81 km/h (50.3 mph)<br>
                  Lions are one of the only big  cats species that  live together in group settings, called a pride. These large cats are infamously known  for work as cooperative team to plan their  strategic tactics, 
                  to obtain a meal. Male cubs  stay with the pride up until the age of 2-3 years old. The juvenile males are either chased  out by the domain  male lions or chased out by a new pride male, that has
                  viciously mauled the former male lion, during  a pride  takeover. Just, because he has won the  war, doesn't mean he has won  the battle with the lionesses. If it's coalition of brothers, it's  very dangerous for 
                  lionesses during  pride  takeover. Regardless of this they will defend their cubs with there lives, even going as far as tricking the male lion into being interested in mating,  
                  to give there pride a chance to get away from dangerous males, which will kill cubs  to through, the existing adult  lioness  into heat. Male lions that take over a pride will also chase off 
                  juvenile lioness. A pride is a tight  unit family, with mothers, daughters, sisters, cousins, and young. As this is the core foundation of a pride, male lions come and go in there lives.
                  With  pride, hunts are more successful, than  a lone lion, and defending one another from  hyenas  always tips the  scale  with there dangerous fight to hold onto a meal.
                  <br>
                  Fun Fact: Lion's roar can be heard from five miles away.

        <h2>Leopard</h2>
        <p>Scientific  Name: Panthera pardus<br>
          Size: Head and body: 4.25 to 6.25 feet; tail: 3.5 to 4.5 feet<br>
          Weight: 66 to 176 pounds<br>
          Speed: 56-60 km/h (35-37 mph)<br>
          
         Leopards are known for their elusive reclusive behavior of not  being heard, but seen till it's too late. 
         These are solitary hunters that dwell in thick brushes of the savannahs. However, they have some of the best  tactics when it comes to hunting, 
         such as, there way of using gravity to land itself a meal. With  there rotating ankles/ wrists, they can climb  up  and down a tree flawlessly. 
         This  comes into  a key role of nimbleness within the branches catching prey from  there as well. They are also innovative, when comes to droughts(Africa's dry season), 
         as they will also go fishing for catfish, in the drying up ponds/rivers. There are pros  to being solitary hunters, however, being  solitary have its cons, 
         they are more likely to lose their prey to larger animal,  if they haven't secured there prey up a tree, moments after a hunt, it would  be taken  usually 
         by the optimistic hyena. With  that note, cubs soully depend  upon  there  mother for everything, such as, protection and meals. Which leaves them vulnerable
         when there mother is away hunting, which  in return  yields more  cub deaths, as each predator seeks  out each others cubs, 
         to reduce the competition for prey resources. It's  a 2/5 chance a leopard cub  would  make it to adolescents, and  the adolescents making it to adulthood. 
          <br>
          Fun Fact: The dark spots on their bodies are called rosettes.

        <h2>Cheetah</h2>
        <p>Scientific  Name: Acinonyx jubatus<br>
          Size: Body: 3.7 to 4.6 feet; tail: two to 2.7 feet<br>
          Weight: 77 to 143 pounds<br>
          Cheetahs are known  for  there 0-70 mph sprint which leaves them air born for few minutes before there feet touch the ground once more again, 
          with that great speed they us  there  tails as rutters to make sharp aerodynamic turns in pursuit of prey. 
          They are more  successful to  catch prey, however, less likely to keep their prey, as they lose 75% of their 
          meals  to bigger and badder predators. Cubs  are also dependent upon their mothers for the necessity and have  
          very risky journey to adolescents into adulthood which doesn't guarantee that  they wouldn't get killed by lion in  
          there adult life as well. Being a cheetah is very  complicated life, they have to sleep with a one eye open. Their speed makes  
          up for  it, as it makes it harder for them to be killed by larger predators and they adapted by consuming there meal much quicker 
          before larger  predators come. There  cubs also  adapted by looking  like a honey badger, which they use there fur to blind in to  the tall grasses. 
          Cheetahs have  been redeem as none big cats, due to fact they purr, so they are known  as little cats.
          <br>
          Fun Fact: Cheetahs are the only big cats (little cats), that can't retract their claws.

              When did each big cat/ little cat 
              diverged in there evolution after feliformia 
              there common ancestor?</h4><br>
              <p style="font-size: 17px; ">
              Previously, paleontologist believed  that  cave lions and  modern lions diverged from feliformia  
              five hundred thousand years ago, however the new estimation, through full mitochondrial sequences 
              and multiple fossil constraints, instead  of  fragments, have come to outstanding  observation that 
              they may, have started there divergence 1.89 million years ago. Leopards, are a complex  case observation, 
              due to fact that  there origin isn't located in Africa, but in Eurasia, during the Early Pleistocene. 
              There isn't  significant  amount  of data on the reclusive felidae,  even  their bones are elusive. 
              However, they have created estimates time zone, such as, the African and Eurasian mitochondrial lineages 
              (~710 Ka), whereas  the Asian lineages (~483 Ka), which is a ancient sister  to all European lineages, 
              and lastly, modern and historical mainland Asian lineages share a relatively recent common ancestor (~122 Ka). 
              The cheetah, has numerous molecular, which suggest it diverged six to eight million years ago, right here in North America.

      What are the historical and current 
      ranges of the lion, leopard, & cheetah?</h4><br>
              <p style="font-size: 17px;text-align: left; ">
                Historically, lions ranged from  Africa to east Asia,
                and also south Europe. However, in the present day, lions range mainly in Africa,  
                and it's small population in Asia( Asiatic Lions). There populations has drastically 
                dropped over the years, are now ranging in twenty thousands in the wild, and  are classified
                as endangered. Like suggest before, leopards has traveled across  the Asia peninsula, and has 
                resided from, east Asia to Africa, also, including Persian.  Sadly,  that was there historically
                range. There current range is Africa and fragmentation in east Asia, they are also located in the 
                south American. There population sits at two hundred and  fifty thousand, this isn't  including  
                there subspecies. Cheetahs have the lowest population on record,  at seven thousand one hundred, 
                they use  to  range from Africa to east Asia,  however, there  are near extinction, and are critically 
                endangered. All big cats, doesn't  matter where they are from, they need are  help and protect.
